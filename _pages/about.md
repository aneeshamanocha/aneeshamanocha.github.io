Hi! I am currently a second year PhD student and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley in the [Energy Resources Group](https://erg.berkeley.edu/). I am also receiving my master's in Energy & Resources and master's in [Electrical Engineerging & Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley. My main interests revolve around developing optimization methods and macro-energy system models to plan decarbonized energy futures. Specifically, I aim to research how to prioritize historical environmental injustices in modeling frameworks.

I was previously a [Kanders Churchill Scholar](https://www.churchillscholarship.org/) at the University of Cambridge, where I received an MPhil in Public Policy with Distinction. I also completed my undergraduate degree at Princeton University, where I worked as a research assistant in the [ZERO lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/) and was advised by [Professor Jesse Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/jesse-jenkins) on modeling co-located renewable energy and storage resources in [GenX](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl). I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering with certificates in Sustainable Energy, Environmental Studies, Statistics and Machine Learning, and Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science.
